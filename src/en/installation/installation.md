# Install GC Design System

GC Design System is in testing phase. Public servants can try out and use the design system. Be an early adopter. Install it and start experimenting!

## Why GC Design Systemâ€™s right for you

Use GC Design System to meet Government of Canada requirements for digital service delivery and communication.

- Simplify your digital delivery.
- Work in the framework you want to work in.
- Help create seamless Government of Canada service experiences.
- Build products that [meet or exceed GC accessibility standards]({{ links.accessibility }}).

## How our updates work

Changes to GC Design System (GCDS) come in a single version update with tokens, components, and (usually) non-breaking changes. GC Design System is independent of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) and GCWeb.

## Choose the option that works best for you

The GCDS-component library works in multiple frameworks and can also be used framework free. Choose the environment you're building in and follow the instructions to get started.
