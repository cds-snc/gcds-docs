# Install GC Design System

Use GC Design System whether you’re building static HTML pages or dynamic applications using a JavaScript framework.

- Simplify your digital delivery.
- Work in the framework you want to work in.
- Create recognizable and trusted digital Government of Canada experiences.
- Build products that <gcds-link href="{{links.accessibility}}">meet or exceed GC accessibility standards</gcds-link>.

## How it works

GC Design System provides reusable and customizable web components. The components are self-contained, combining their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for encapsulation and reuse.

- The components are tech-agnostic and can be used in any web project, regardless of the underlying framework.
- The design system uses <gcds-link href="{{links.designTokens}}">design tokens</gcds-link> to capture brand and design decisions in code for style elements like colours, typography, and spacing.
- Changes come in a single-version update with tokens, components, and (usually) non-breaking changes.
- The design system is independent of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) and GCWeb, but it’s aligned with Canada.ca Specifications.
