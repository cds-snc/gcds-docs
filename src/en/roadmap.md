## Product Roadmap Disclaimer: Change is Expected
The product roadmap is a living document, subject to change based on shifting priorities, resource availability, and unforeseen dependencies. Any item that has not yet started may be reprioritized or replaced by a higher-value initiative. Items currently in progress may encounter delays as we navigate challenges and learn along the way.

We share this roadmap to foster transparency, encourage collaboration, and align with our stakeholders. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome as we refine our path forward.
