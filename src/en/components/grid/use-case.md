## Problems grids solve

Grids create column layouts that keep content elements grouped across different devices and screens.

Use grids to:

- Apply a flexible column layout that scales to the screen size (viewport) of the user's device.
- Guide focus by defining the width of a column and the spacing between columns.
- Create complex layouts with control over the sizing of each column.
- Accommodate different screen sizes by setting a custom, optimized layout for different viewports, like mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Limit the width of content displayed to ensure lines wrap and are more readable.
