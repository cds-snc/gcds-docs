## Design and accessibility

### Choose the appropriate notice type

- Refer to the use case tab for guidelines on when to use each notice type.

### Write concise and descriptive headings and messages

- Write a meaningful heading that’s short and simple to highlight the goal of the notice.
- In the heading, use words like “warning” and “success” that match the meaning conveyed by the icon and colour of the notice type you selected.  
- Craft the message (below the heading) to be brief and impactful, ideally within three sentences.  
- Save the details for the main content area of a page. The notice is meant to attract attention and create an information trail for anyone who needs to know more.

### Use links to guide people to additional details if necessary

- Use links to connect to additional details for a person who wants to read more.  
- Opt to create a dedicated page for more detailed content and use a short message in a notice to draw interested people to that page.
- Avoid long notices. They can be distracting and frustrating.

### Use notices sparingly to avoid visual fatigue

- Limit the number of notices on a page. People become less receptive to notices and warning messages the more often they encounter them.
- Make sure to remove notices once they’ve served their purpose.

### Place notices where you’d place a paragraph

- Add a notice where you’d add an important paragraph (or section) on the page.
- Consider placing the notice at the top of the page or content section to avoid it being overlooked.
- Avoid using a notice within a form component, like an input or a checkbox.
