## Date modified anatomy

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>label</strong> describes the type specified in the value. The label reads either: "Date modified" or "Version" depending on the component type.</li>
  <li>The <strong>value</strong> is either a numerical date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or a version number.</li>
</ol>

<img class="b-sm b-default p-300" src="/images/en/components/anatomy/gcds-date-modified-anatomy.svg" alt="Date modified with 2023-01-30. Each individual element of the component has a number pointing to it." />

## Design and accessibility for date modified

### Check date modified requirements

The date modified is required on Canada.ca pages and GC sites.

#### What’s required on Canada.ca and GC sites

Always include the date modified and maintain default settings.

- Place the date modified component on the left, between the main content of the page and the footer.
- Use the same placement of the date modified component across all web pages to make it findable.
- If your page includes the page feedback tool, place the date modified component below it.

#### What’s optional to include on Canada.ca pages

For applications, use a version number in place of a date.

### Keep the format consistent

- Use the YYYY-MM-DD date format across all web pages.
- If using the version type, apply a standard version number format across all products.

### When to update the date modified

- Only update the date modified when you make a significant content change.
- Avoid updating for minor corrections, like typos, or small changes to the code.

### Ensure consistent placement

- Place the date modified component between the body, or main content, of the page and the footer.
- Use the same placement of the date modified component across all web pages to make it findable.
