Review common uses for pagination to see if they match the problem you’re solving for.

## Pagination use cases

Use pagination for very lengthy content on a single page that might be difficult to navigate, to reduce cognitive load, and to:

- Display search results when there’s a long list of returns, reducing the time it takes to load and amount of scrolling.
- Allow users to move through indexed content using next, previous, and page links.
- Split into sections any long documents, like reports, that have chapters or other natural divisions.
- Highlight the reader’s position in a sequence of content.
