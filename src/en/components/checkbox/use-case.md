Take a look at what checkboxes do to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems checkboxes solve

Use a checkbox with a [fieldset]({{ links.fieldset }}) to make a request for info with a set of options when you are expecting the user to select one or more options from a short list of items to:

- Limit the number of answers to your question.
- Let a person choose one or several answers from a contained list by checking off the right ones.
- Give a person the ability to answer without writing by selecting one or multiple items from a list.
