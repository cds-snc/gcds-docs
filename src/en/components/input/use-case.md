Take a look at what inputs do to see if they fit the problem you're solving for. Then select the best input type for the use case you need to meet.

## Problems inputs solve

Use an input to gather single-line information from a person when you're expecting a person will write:

- An individual or unique response.
- A short freeform response.
- A response that needs constraints around text length or the format of the response.
- Essential identifying or contact information.
- A date they already know, like a date of birth (for selection of an unknown date, use a date picker).

Note: Only collect information you're authorized to handle and be sure to safeguard it to Government of Canada standards.

Date selectors when you want someone to choose a not-yet-known date, like for appointment scheduling.

## Choose an input type

Set the input type based on how the input will validate the values a person enters.
The input `type` attribute accepts the following options:

### Text input uses

- Use when no other specfic input type is available for single-line entry.
- To collect a person's name, in most cases by full name.
- Instead of the number input, for things like estimates that can have non-numerical values.

### Email input

- For email address collection.
- To require an email address format.

### Password input

- For password collection and validation.
- To set specific password constraints.

Tip: Communicate any password constraints in the hint text for the input so the person choosing the password knows exactly what the rules are.

### Number input

To reject values that are non numerical.

Tip: When you set a constraint, like a numerical range, use hint text to relay a precise instruction.

### Search input

To collect search queries.

### URL input

To collect a URL, like a web address or domain name.
