## Language toggle anatomy

The language toggle provides a link to the page in the other Official Language.

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>toggle link</strong> navigates to the page in the other Official Language and appears in short form on smaller screens, or viewports.</li>
</ol>

<img class="b-sm b-default p-300" src="/images/en/components/anatomy/gcds-lang-toggle-anatomy.svg" alt="Large screen sized language toggle with “Français” link and small screen sized language toggle with “FR” link. Each individual element of the component has a number pointing to it."/>

## Design and accessibility for the language toggle

### Check language toggle requirements

The language toggle is required in the header on Canada.ca pages and GC sites.

#### What’s required on Canada.ca and GC sites

Always include the language toggle in the header and maintain default settings.

- Keep the placement in the top right corner of the header where it’s predictable and findable.
- Only include English and French as options.
- In the language toggle link, include the opposite Official Language of the current page.

#### What’s optional to include on a Canada.ca page

If needed, include links to content in other languages in the content area of the page
