## Checkboxes anatomy

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>legend for checkboxes</strong> acts as a heading to identify the grouped checkboxes. Legend text is left aligned and in sentence case (only the initial letter is capitalized).</li>
  <li>The <strong>hint text for checkboxes</strong> communicates specific requirements for the checkbox grouping to support task success.</li>
  <li>The <strong>checkbox</strong> shows, by the presence or absence of the <strong>checkmark</strong> (also called the checked box), whether an option has been selected or not.</li>
  <li>The <strong>checkmark</strong> shows that an option has been selected.</li>
  <li>The <strong>option label</strong> states the choice the checkbox represents. Label text is in sentence case.</li>
  <li>The <strong>option hint text</strong> gives users additional information about the choice.</li>
</ol>

## Design and accessibility for checkboxes

### Make selections clear

- Limit the number of options to 7.  
- Limit text for each option to a few words or a short phrase. Include hint text if more context is needed.  
- Order options in a logical way. This could mean alphabetically or from most to least common.

### Make instructions clear

- Avoid assuming a person will know how to use a checkbox.  
- Use the hint text to specify they can make multiple selections. For example, "Select all that apply".  
- Avoid pre-selecting a checkbox. This makes it more likely that users will miss a question and submit the wrong answer.
