## Problems side navigation solves

It’s optional to use side navigation in products for:

- Making second and third level navigation visible in information architectures that have 1-3 levels of navigation.
- Presenting a consistent navigation across pages with a large number of top level items, like technical documentation with broad category sets.  
- Enabling navigation between various categories or sections so a person can scan and compare like objects in a set.  
- Providing ready access to global navigation between deep navigation structures.
