## Problems cards solve

Cards organize information on the same subject in a static box shaped like a playing card.

Use a card to:

- Group small pieces of related information as a unit.
- Present bite-sized previews and summaries of information with a means to obtain more details elsewhere.
- Support content discovery by creating more visual interest.

Note: For Canada.ca, avoid using cards in place of the doormats with the templates for landing page and theme and topic page.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-primary text-light pt-600 pb-300 my-600">
  <h2 class="mt-0">Related components</h2>

<a href="{{ links.details }}" class="link-light">Details</a> to hide secondary information that a person can expand on the same page.

<a href="{{ links.container }}" class="link-light">Container</a> for basic layouts with a set width.
