## Button anatomy

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>container</strong> gives the button its visually prominence.</li>
  <li>The <strong>label</strong> states the action that’ll happen when someone interacts with the button. Text is in sentence case, where only the first letter is capitalized.</li>
</ol>

## Design and accessibility for buttons

### Make the button findable

- Limit the number of buttons on a page. Reserve buttons for the most important actions.
- Place buttons in a regular and predictable way.
- Avoid making a person needlessly scroll, tab, or type by providing the path to the next action early.
- Check the button border’s visibility against the surface where you’re placing it.

### Write short, specific, and descriptive button labels

- Make the button’s action obvious with a short, specific label that has a verb, or a verb and a noun, like “Submit” or “Get estimate”.
- Use sentence case.
- Use unique and specific accompanying text to prevent repetition for screen readers.
- Use literal phrases. Avoid expressions that may be unfamiliar to non-fluent speakers.
