## Problems screenreader-only solves

Use screenreader-only to:

- Provide context to people using screen reader assistive technologies.
- Offer a text option to communicate information typically solely available by visual means.
- Communicate effectively without adding more text to the main content. This helps reduce cognitive load for everyone by only providing content when and where it’s needed.
- Improve the assistive tech experience when there are no other suitable options in semantic HTML.
