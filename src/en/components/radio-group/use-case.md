Take a look at what problems radio groups solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems radio groups solves

Use radio groups with a [fieldset]({{ links.fieldset }}). Use a radio group to request a single-option response within a short set and to:

- Limit the number of possible answers to your question.
- Specify the possible answers to your question.
- Give a person the ability to answer without writing by selecting one item from a list.
