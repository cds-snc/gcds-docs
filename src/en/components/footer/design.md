## Design and accessibility for footers

GC Design System components are designed to adapt to the size of the screen or frame where they’re being viewed. As an exception, the text size in the header and footer is fixed.

### Add optional bands

- Consider using the contextual band to give people specific actions or information related to your site.
- While required on all standard pages, consider using the main band for any pages on Canada.ca.

### Modify links

- In the contextual band, modify the three links to your specific site. Choose links that people will expect to find in a footer, like “Contact us”, “Careers” or “News”.
- In the GC footer links band, modify the “Terms and conditions” and “Privacy” links to your specific site.
- Make link text clear and specific to help a person decide if they should leave the current page. Spell out where a person will go or what they’ll find when they select a link.
