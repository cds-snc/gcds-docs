## Problems top navigation solves

The top navigation helps give visitors a sense of a site's structure, purpose, and priorities. It's optional to use for websites to:

- Place popular links in a prominent position on the page.
- Provide up to two levels of site hierarchy.
- Offer a familiar wayfinding pattern.
- Signal the active page and give a cue to the person's current position on the site.

  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

<a href="{{ links.sideNav }}" class="link-light">Side navigation</a> for products with up to three levels of navigation when the main content fits a narrow page width.

<a href="{{ links.header }}" class="link-light">Header</a> for placing the Government of Canada branded header landmark.

<a href="{{ links.breadcrumbs }}" class="link-light">Breadcrumbs</a> for a path from each level of the site's hierarchy to the current page.
