## Problems top navigation solves

The top navigation helps give visitors a sense of a site's structure, purpose, and priorities. It's optional to use for websites to:

- Place popular links in a prominent position on the page.
- Provide up to two levels of site hierarchy.
- Offer a familiar wayfinding pattern.
- Signal the active page and give a cue to the person's current position on the site.
