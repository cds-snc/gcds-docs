Take a look at what problems fieldsets solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems fieldsets solve

Use a fieldset to group together related form elements or components so they're perceivable when:

- A set of options corresponds to the same question, like with [radios]({{ links.radio }}) or [checkboxes]({{ links.checkbox }}).
- Several questions in a flow relate to the same topic, like a set of [inputs]({{ links.input }}) or other combination of form components.
- Logically grouping form elements or components helps support understanding and usability.

<a href="{{ links.input }}">Inputs</a> or <a href="{{ links.textarea }}">text areas</a> when you are requesting a written response from a person.

<a href="{{ links.pagination }}">Pagination</a> when you are spreading form elements across multiple pages.
