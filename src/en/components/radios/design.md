  <li>The <strong>hint text for radios</strong> gives specific requirements for selecting the appropriate response.</li>
  <li>The <strong>radio button</strong> indicates the state of the selection.</li>
  <li>The <strong>checked button</strong> shows what option has been selected.</li>
  <li>The <strong>option label</strong> describes the selection. Label text is in sentence case.</li>
  <li>The <strong>option hint text</strong> gives additional information about the selection.</li>
</ol>

## Design and accessibility for radios

### Make selections clear

- Limit the number of options to 7.  
- Limit text for each option to a few words or a short phrase. Include hint text if more context is needed.  
- Order options in a logical way. This could mean alphabetically or from most to least common.  
- When possible, include a "None of the above" option to avoid forcing an incorrect selection. A selection can't be unselected unless another option is selected.

### Make instructions clear

- Don't assume a person will know they can only select one answer.  
- Use the hint text to specify they can only make one selection. For example, "Select the response that best applies‚Äù.  
- Avoid pre-selecting a radio option. This makes it more likely that a person will miss a question and submit the wrong answer.
