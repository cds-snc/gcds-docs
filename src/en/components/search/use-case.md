Search is a required component for Canada.ca pages.

## Use cases for search

Use search to help a person on your website or page find information:

- Indexed on Canada.ca, across all Government of Canada content or at an institution or program level.
- From a subset of content you have locally indexed, using your own data set.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-primary text-light pt-600 pb-300 my-600">
  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-300">Related components</h2>

  <a href="{{ links.header }}" class="link-light">Header</a> for placing the Government of Canada branded header landmark.

<a href="{{ links.input }}" class="link-light">Input</a> for requesting a short written response from a person.
