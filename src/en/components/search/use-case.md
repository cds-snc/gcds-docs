Search is a required component for standard and campaign pages on Canada.ca.

Take a look at what problems search solves to see if they fit the problem youâ€™re solving for.

## Problems search solves

Use search to help a person on your website or page find information:

- Indexed on Canada.ca, across all Government of Canada content or at an institution or program level.
- From a subset of content you have locally indexed, using your own data set.
