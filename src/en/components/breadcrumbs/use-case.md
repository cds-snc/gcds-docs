Check out use cases for breadcrumbs to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems breadcrumbs solve

Use breadcrumbs to signal a visitor's current location and give them a sense of place in the navigation model, and to:

- Provide a linear way to move between multiple levels of a website.
- Surface part of the site's structure to help people understand where to find what they need.
- Situate the current page in relation to its parent in the site structure.
- Organize websites in a hierarchy of more than two levels.
