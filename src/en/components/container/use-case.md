## Problems containers solves

Containers group related content in a space.

Use containers to:

- Arrange content and components in a basic vertical layout using a wrapper.
- Limit the width of content in a given space within a site or product.
- Support readability and scannability by reducing the overall length of a line of text and presenting smaller chunks of content at a time.
- Centre content on a screen or within a viewport.
