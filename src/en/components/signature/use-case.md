Signature is a required component for Government of Canada websites.

## Problems the signature solves

Use the signature landmark as part of a trusted brand to:

- Provide site visitors with a recognizable corporate identity.
- Inform a person they’re reading content published by the Government of Canada.
- Offer a global link to the site’s home page in both Official Languages.
