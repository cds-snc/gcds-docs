## Signature anatomy

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>Government of Canada Signature</strong> is a brand identifier found in the site's <gcds-link href="{{ links.header }}">header</gcds-link>. The signature is used as a global link to the site's homepage.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Canada Wordmark</strong> is a brand identifier found in the site's <gcds-link href="{{ links.footer }}">footer</gcds-link>. It reinforces the brand by communicating to a site visitor that they're reading content from the Government of Canada.</li>

## Design and accessibility for the signature

### Set the language order in the signature

Display the French-first signature on French pages and the English-first on English pages.

**Note:** The image is hyperlinked to the Canada.ca homepage in the same Official Language as the current page.

### Apply non-standard colours accessibly

- Opt to apply non-standard colours when a higher level of contrast with the background is needed, like for dark mode.
- Opt to apply non-standard colours when a single colour is used in a product, like in black and white.
- When making changes to the flag colour, always match the colour of the flag symbol in the signature and in the wordmark.
- Always apply the same colour combination in the signature and wordmark. For example, if one is black and white, the other needs to be as well.
- For single colour, check the contrast ratio between the signature elements for, at minimum, WCAG AA compliance.

The standard colour style uses black text and a red flag applied to a white backdrop.

The signature type is on the left and the wordmark type is on the right. This variation has white text on a black back drop" />

The reversed colour style uses white text and a red flag applied to a black backdrop.

<img class="b-sm b-default p-300 mb-300" src="/images/en/components/example/example-signature-bw-en.svg" alt="An image presenting two signature and wordmark pairings. One where the signature and wordmark are all black on a white backdrop and the second where the signature and wordmark are all white on a black backdrop." />

The black and white style uses all black or all white. All black is the more common use.

<img class="b-sm b-default p-300 mb-300" src="/images/en/components/example/example-signature-single-colour-style-en.svg" alt="An image showing the the signature and wordmark in dark purple on a light purple backdrop. There are bars and boxes simulating text and pictures, you are to assume this is a mock webpage. The text and pictures boxes are also dark purple." />

Single colour style uses another colour if that colour is the only colour used in the product.
