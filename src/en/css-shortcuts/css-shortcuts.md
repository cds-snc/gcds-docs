# CSS Shortcuts

Every digital product needs some custom styling. We did the work for you.

CSS Shortcuts is a CSS utility framework built to match GC Design System (GCDS) styles and Canada.ca standards. It provides predefined CSS utility classes that apply core design elements, like colours, spacing, and typography, to your HTML. The classes align with our [GCDS design tokens]({{ links.designTokens }}) for consistency and ease of use.

## How to use CSS Shortcuts

1. [Add the CSS stylesheet into your project]({{ links.getStartedDevelop }}). Different frameworks add it in different places.
2. Explore the different styling options in the menu.
3. Add the classes to their corresponding HTML to adjust the styling to meet your needs.

## Benefits

### Match styles

CSS Shortcuts lets you apply [predefined design tokens]({{ links.designTokens }}) directly to your HTML elements. These design tokens are used throughout GCDS, so your custom code will match our components.

### Faster development, less maintenance

Your code becomes simpler, clearer, and easier to maintain. We handle the updates, not you.

### No third-party dependency

CSS Shortcuts is built to meet the needs of the Government of Canada. Unlike other commonly used utility frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, CSS Shortcuts is fully under our control.

### Accessibility built in

Add custom code to meet your specific needs, with the reassurance of knowing itâ€™s been built to meet [GC accessibility standards]({{ links.accessibility }}).
