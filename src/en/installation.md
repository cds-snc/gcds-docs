# Install GC Design System

GC Design System is in testing phase. Public servants can try out and use the design system. Be an early adopter. Install it and start experimenting!  

## Why GC Design System’s right for you

Use GC Design System to meet Government of Canada requirements for digital service delivery and communication.

- Simplify your digital delivery.
- Work in the framework you want to work in.
- Help create seamless Government of Canada service experiences.
- Build products that [meet or exceed GC accessibility standards](https://design-system.alpha.canada.ca/en/accessibility/).

## How our updates work

Changes to GC Design System (GCDS) come in a single version update with tokens, components, and (usually) non-breaking changes. GC Design System is independent of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) and GCWeb.
